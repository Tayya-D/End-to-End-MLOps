## Install
- Anaconda

Alternatively, use Google CoLab or GitHub Codespace

---

## Create an Environment 

In your project folder:

conda create -p venv python==3.12

install libraries 

Activate the env via:

conda activate venv/

To create a jupyter notebook e.g touch test.ipynb

Select kernel from venv (python)

To run a cell - hold Shift and Enter

Can add code blocks and markdown blocks in the file -> Allows you to execute code and document at the same time

install the .ipykernel if not already installed. This kernel is responsible for running and executing the python code in this particular jupyter notebook

create a requirements.txt to list the desired packages in one place. Can run the file with a specific command to install all the listed packages in our env in one go

python files can be run with the command 'pthon <filenmae>' in the terminal as opposed to the notebook files; which the cells can be individually executed via Shift+Enter
