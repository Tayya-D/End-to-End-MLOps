# Python Lambda Functions Documentation

## Overview
Lambda functions (also called anonymous functions) are small, single-expression functions in Python defined using the `lambda` keyword. They are useful for short operations and as arguments to higher-order functions.

## Key Features
- **Anonymous**: No function name required
- **Single expression**: Limited to one logical operation
- **Compact syntax**: `lambda arguments: expression`
- **Common uses**: With `map()`, `filter()`, and other higher-order functions

## Basic Syntax
```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

## Examples

### 1. Simple Addition
```python
# Regular function
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Equivalent lambda
add_lambda = lambda a, b: a + b

print(add(2, 3))          # 5
print(add_lambda(2, 3))   # 5
```

### 2. Even Number Check
```python
# Regular function
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

# Equivalent lambda
is_even_lambda = lambda num: num % 2 == 0

print(is_even(24))          # True
print(is_even_lambda(24))   # True
```

### 3. Three-Number Addition
```python
# Regular function
def add_three(x, y, z):
    return x + y + z

# Equivalent lambda
add_three_lambda = lambda x, y, z: x + y + z

print(add_three(12, 13, 14))        # 39
print(add_three_lambda(12, 13, 14)) # 39
```

## Lambda with Map
Lambda functions are commonly used with `map()` to apply operations to iterables:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Square all numbers using map+lambda
squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
print(squared)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
```

## When to Use Lambda Functions
1. For simple operations that can be expressed in a single line
2. When you need a short function temporarily (especially with `map`, `filter`, `sort`)
3. To improve code readability for simple transformations

## When NOT to Use Lambda Functions
1. For complex logic requiring multiple expressions
2. When the function needs to be reused multiple times
3. When the operation would benefit from a descriptive function name

## Best Practices
1. Keep lambda functions short and simple
2. Use meaningful variable names when assigning lambdas
3. Consider regular functions for complex operations
4. Use comments when the lambda logic isn't immediately obvious

Lambda functions provide a concise way to write small, one-off functions in Python, especially when working with higher-order functions that operate on other functions.
