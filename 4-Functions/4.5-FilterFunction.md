# Python `filter()` Function Documentation

## Overview
The `filter()` function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns `True`. It provides an efficient way to filter collections based on conditions without explicit loops.

## Key Features
- Returns elements from an iterable that satisfy a condition
- Works with both named functions and lambda functions
- Returns a filter object (convertible to list/tuple)
- Memory efficient (lazy evaluation)
- Can handle complex filtering conditions

## Basic Syntax
```python
filter(function, iterable)
```

## Examples

### 1. Basic Number Filtering
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

# Using named function
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

evens = list(filter(is_even, numbers))
# [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]

# Using lambda function
evens_lambda = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
# Same result
```

### 2. Multiple Conditions
```python
# Filter numbers > 5 AND even
filtered = list(filter(lambda x: x > 5 and x % 2 == 0, numbers))
# [6, 8, 10, 12]
```

### 3. Filtering Dictionaries
```python
people = [
    {"name": "Krish", "age": 32},
    {"name": "Jack", "age": 33},
    {"name": "John", "age": 25}
]

# Filter people over age 25
over_25 = list(filter(lambda p: p["age"] > 25, people))
# [{'name': 'Krish', 'age': 32}, {'name': 'Jack', 'age': 33}]
```

### 4. String Filtering
```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]

# Filter words longer than 5 characters
long_words = list(filter(lambda w: len(w) > 5, words))
# ["banana", "cherry", "elderberry"]
```

## Best Practices
1. **Use lambda for simple conditions**: Keeps code concise for straightforward filters
2. **Named functions for complexity**: Use named functions when logic is complex
3. **Combine conditions carefully**: Use logical operators (`and`, `or`) for multiple conditions
4. **Consider readability**: Balance conciseness with clarity
5. **Convert to concrete types**: Remember to convert filter objects to lists when needed

## Performance Considerations
- More memory efficient than list comprehensions for large datasets
- Lazy evaluation (processes items on-demand)
- Often faster than equivalent for-loops for filtering operations

## Common Use Cases
- Data cleaning and validation
- Removing invalid/empty values
- Extracting specific subsets of data
- Preprocessing before analysis
- Conditional data extraction from complex structures

## Comparison Table
| Approach | Readability | Performance | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `filter()` | High for simple conditions | Excellent | Conditional filtering |
| List Comprehension | High | Good | Simple filters |
| For-loop | Medium | Good | Complex filtering logic |

The `filter()` function is particularly powerful when combined with lambda functions for concise, readable data filtering operations. It's commonly used in data processing pipelines alongside `map()` for comprehensive data transformations.
