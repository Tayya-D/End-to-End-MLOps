### Summary of Python Operators Notes

This document provides an overview of Python operators, including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators. Below is a concise summary of the topics covered:

---

### 1. **Introduction to Operators**
   - **Operators** are used to perform arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations in Python.
   - They are essential for performing calculations, comparisons, and decision-making in programs.

---

### 2. **Arithmetic Operators**
   - **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two numbers.
     ```python
     a = 10
     b = 15
     result = a + b  # Output: 25
     ```
   - **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts one number from another.
     ```python
     result = a - b  # Output: -5
     ```
   - **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two numbers.
     ```python
     result = a * b  # Output: 150
     ```
   - **Division (`/`)**: Divides one number by another (returns a float).
     ```python
     result = a / b  # Output: 0.666...
     ```
   - **Floor Division (`//`)**: Divides and returns the integer part of the result.
     ```python
     result = a // b  # Output: 0
     ```
   - **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of a division.
     ```python
     result = a % b  # Output: 10
     ```
   - **Exponentiation (`**`)**: Raises a number to the power of another.
     ```python
     result = a ** b  # Output: 1000000000000000
     ```

---

### 3. **Comparison Operators**
   - **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if two values are equal.
     ```python
     a = 10
     b = 10
     result = a == b  # Output: True
     ```
   - **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if two values are not equal.
     ```python
     result = a != b  # Output: False
     ```
   - **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if the left value is greater than the right.
     ```python
     result = a > b  # Output: False
     ```
   - **Less than (`<`)**: Checks if the left value is less than the right.
     ```python
     result = a < b  # Output: False
     ```
   - **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right.
     ```python
     result = a >= b  # Output: True
     ```
   - **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right.
     ```python
     result = a <= b  # Output: True
     ```

---

### 4. **Logical Operators**
   - **AND (`and`)**: Returns `True` if both conditions are true.
     ```python
     x = True
     y = False
     result = x and y  # Output: False
     ```
   - **OR (`or`)**: Returns `True` if at least one condition is true.
     ```python
     result = x or y  # Output: True
     ```
   - **NOT (`not`)**: Reverses the boolean value.
     ```python
     result = not x  # Output: False
     ```

---

### 5. **Practical Example: Simple Calculator**
   - A simple calculator that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations:
     ```python
     num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
     num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

     sum = num1 + num2
     difference = num1 - num2
     product = num1 * num2
     quotient = num1 / num2
     modulus = num1 % num2
     exponent = num1 ** num2

     print("Sum:", sum)
     print("Difference:", difference)
     print("Product:", product)
     print("Quotient:", quotient)
     print("Modulus:", modulus)
     print("Exponent:", exponent)
     ```

### 6. **Key Takeaways**
   - **Arithmetic operators** are used for basic mathematical operations.
   - **Comparison operators** are used to compare values and return `True` or `False`.
   - **Logical operators** are used to combine multiple conditions and return a boolean result.
   - Operators are essential for performing calculations, comparisons, and decision-making in Python programs.
