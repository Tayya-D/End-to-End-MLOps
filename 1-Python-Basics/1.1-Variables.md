### Summary of Python Variables Notes

This document provides an overview of Python variables, including how to declare and assign them, naming conventions, variable types, type checking and conversion, and dynamic typing. Below is a concise summary of the topics covered:

---

### 1. **Introduction to Variables**
   - **Variables** are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program.
   - In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them. No explicit declaration is needed.
     ```python
     a = 100  # Variable 'a' is created and assigned the value 100
     ```

---

### 2. **Declaring and Assigning Variables**
   - Variables can store different types of data, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
     ```python
     age = 32          # Integer
     height = 6.1      # Float
     name = "Chris"    # String
     is_student = True # Boolean
     ```
   - You can print variables to display their values:
     ```python
     print(age)    # Output: 32
     print(height) # Output: 6.1
     print(name)   # Output: Chris
     ```

---

### 3. **Naming Conventions**
   - **Rules for variable names**:
     - Must start with a letter or underscore (`_`).
     - Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
     - Cannot start with a number or contain special characters (e.g., `@`, `-`).
     - Are case-sensitive (`name` and `Name` are different variables).
   - **Examples**:
     ```python
     first_name = "Chris"  # Valid
     _last_name = "Nayak"  # Valid
     1name = "Chris"       # Invalid (starts with a number)
     first-name = "Chris"  # Invalid (contains a hyphen)
     ```

---

### 4. **Variable Types**
   - Python is **dynamically typed**, meaning the type of a variable is determined at runtime.
   - Common data types include:
     - **Integer (`int`)**: Whole numbers (e.g., `25`).
     - **Float (`float`)**: Decimal numbers (e.g., `6.1`).
     - **String (`str`)**: Text (e.g., `"Chris"`).
     - **Boolean (`bool`)**: `True` or `False`.
   - You can check the type of a variable using the `type()` function:
     ```python
     print(type(age))        # Output: <class 'int'>
     print(type(height))     # Output: <class 'float'>
     print(type(name))       # Output: <class 'str'>
     print(type(is_student)) # Output: <class 'bool'>
     ```

---

### 5. **Type Checking and Conversion**
   - **Type Conversion**: You can convert one data type to another using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.
     ```python
     age = 25
     age_str = str(age)  # Convert integer to string
     print(age_str)      # Output: "25"
     print(type(age_str)) # Output: <class 'str'>
     ```
   - **Examples**:
     - Convert string to integer:
       ```python
       age = "25"
       age_int = int(age)  # Convert string to integer
       print(age_int)      # Output: 25
       ```
     - Convert float to integer:
       ```python
       height = 5.11
       height_int = int(height)  # Convert float to integer (removes decimal)
       print(height_int)         # Output: 5
       ```

---

### 6. **Dynamic Typing**
   - Python allows the type of a variable to change during runtime.
     ```python
     var = 10          # Initially an integer
     print(type(var))  # Output: <class 'int'>
     var = "Hello"     # Now a string
     print(type(var))  # Output: <class 'str'>
     var = 3.14        # Now a float
     print(type(var))  # Output: <class 'float'>
     ```

---

### 7. **User Input**
   - Use the `input()` function to get user input. By default, the input is treated as a string.
     ```python
     age = input("Enter your age: ")  # User inputs a value
     print(age)                      # Output: User's input (as string)
     print(type(age))                # Output: <class 'str'>
     ```
   - You can convert the input to other types:
     ```python
     age = int(input("Enter your age: "))  # Convert input to integer
     print(type(age))                      # Output: <class 'int'>
     ```

---

### 8. **Practical Example: Simple Calculator**
   - A simple calculator that takes two numbers as input and performs basic operations:
     ```python
     num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
     num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

     sum = num1 + num2
     difference = num1 - num2
     product = num1 * num2
     quotient = num1 / num2

     print("Sum:", sum)
     print("Difference:", difference)
     print("Product:", product)
     print("Quotient:", quotient)
     ```

---

### 9. **Key Takeaways**
   - Variables are used to store data and do not require explicit type declaration.
   - Python is dynamically typed, allowing variables to change types during runtime.
   - Follow proper naming conventions for variables (e.g., start with a letter or underscore).
   - Use `type()` to check the type of a variable and type conversion functions (`int()`, `float()`, `str()`) to convert between types.
   - The `input()` function allows user input, which is treated as a string by default.
