### Summary of Python Loops Notes

This document provides an overview of Python loops, including **for loops**, **while loops**, **loop control statements** (break, continue, pass), and **nested loops**. Below is a concise summary of the topics covered:

---

### 1. **For Loop**
   - A **for loop** is used to iterate over a sequence of items (e.g., numbers, strings, lists).
   - **Syntax**:
     ```python
     for i in range(5):  # Iterates from 0 to 4
         print(i)
     ```
   - **Range Function**:
     - `range(start, stop, step)` generates a sequence of numbers.
     - Example:
       ```python
       for i in range(1, 10, 2):  # Iterates from 1 to 9 with a step of 2
           print(i)  # Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
       ```

---

### 2. **While Loop**
   - A **while loop** continues to execute as long as a condition is `True`.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```python
     count = 0
     while count < 5:
         print(count)
         count += 1  # Increment count
     ```
   - Example:
     ```python
     count = 0
     while count < 5:
         print(count)  # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
         count += 1
     ```

---

### 3. **Loop Control Statements**
   - **Break**: Exits the loop prematurely.
     ```python
     for i in range(10):
         if i == 5:
             break  # Exit loop when i is 5
         print(i)  # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
     ```
   - **Continue**: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next.
     ```python
     for i in range(10):
         if i % 2 == 0:
             continue  # Skip even numbers
         print(i)  # Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
     ```
   - **Pass**: A null operation (does nothing). Used as a placeholder.
     ```python
     for i in range(5):
         if i == 3:
             pass  # Do nothing
         print(i)  # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
     ```

---

### 4. **Nested Loops**
   - A **nested loop** is a loop inside another loop.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```python
     for i in range(3):  # Outer loop
         for j in range(2):  # Inner loop
             print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
     ```
   - Example Output:
     ```
     i=0, j=0
     i=0, j=1
     i=1, j=0
     i=1, j=1
     i=2, j=0
     i=2, j=1
     ```

---

### 5. **Practical Examples**
   - **Sum of First N Natural Numbers**:
     - Using a **while loop**:
       ```python
       n = 10
       sum = 0
       count = 1
       while count <= n:
           sum += count
           count += 1
       print(f"Sum of first {n} natural numbers: {sum}")  # Output: 55
       ```
     - Using a **for loop**:
       ```python
       n = 10
       sum = 0
       for i in range(1, n+1):
           sum += i
       print(f"Sum of first {n} natural numbers: {sum}")  # Output: 55
       ```
   - **Display Prime Numbers Between 1 and 100**:
     ```python
     for num in range(1, 101):
         if num > 1:
             for i in range(2, num):
                 if num % i == 0:
                     break
             else:
                 print(num)  # Output: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., 97
     ```

### 6. **Key Takeaways**
   - **For loops** are ideal for iterating over sequences (e.g., lists, strings, ranges).
   - **While loops** are useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance.
   - **Loop control statements** (`break`, `continue`, `pass`) allow for more flexible loop behavior.
   - **Nested loops** are used to handle complex iterations (e.g., multi-dimensional data).
