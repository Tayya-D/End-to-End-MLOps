### Summary of Python Control Flow: Conditional Statements Notes

This document provides an overview of Python control flow, focusing on conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and nested conditional statements. Below is a concise summary of the topics covered:

---

### 1. **Introduction to Conditional Statements**
   - **Conditional statements** are used to make decisions in Python based on certain conditions.
   - They allow the program to execute specific blocks of code depending on whether a condition is `True` or `False`.

---

### 2. **If Statement**
   - The `if` statement evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is `True`.
     ```python
     age = 20
     if age >= 18:
         print("You are allowed to vote in the elections.")
     ```
   - If the condition is `True`, the code inside the `if` block is executed. Otherwise, it is skipped.

---

### 3. **Else Statement**
   - The `else` statement executes a block of code if the condition in the `if` statement is `False`.
     ```python
     age = 16
     if age >= 18:
         print("You are eligible for voting.")
     else:
         print("You are a minor.")
     ```
   - If the `if` condition is `False`, the code inside the `else` block is executed.

---

### 4. **Elif Statement**
   - The `elif` (else if) statement allows you to check multiple conditions. It is used when you have more than two possible outcomes.
     ```python
     age = 17
     if age < 13:
         print("You are a child.")
     elif age < 18:
         print("You are a teenager.")
     else:
         print("You are an adult.")
     ```
   - The `elif` statement is evaluated only if the previous `if` or `elif` conditions are `False`.

---

### 5. **Nested Conditional Statements**
   - You can place one or more `if`, `elif`, or `else` statements inside another `if`, `elif`, or `else` block to create **nested conditional statements**.
     ```python
     number = int(input("Enter the number: "))
     if number > 0:
         if number % 2 == 0:
             print("The number is positive and even.")
         else:
             print("The number is positive and odd.")
     else:
         print("The number is zero or negative.")
     ```
   - Nested conditions are useful for handling complex decision-making scenarios.

### 6. **Practical Examples**
   - **Leap Year Checker**: Determine if a year is a leap year using nested conditional statements.
     ```python
     year = int(input("Enter the year: "))
     if year % 4 == 0:
         if year % 100 == 0:
             if year % 400 == 0:
                 print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
             else:
                 print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
         else:
             print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
     else:
         print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
     ```
   - **Simple Calculator**: Perform basic arithmetic operations based on user input.
     ```python
     num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
     num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
     operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ")

     if operation == '+':
         result = num1 + num2
     elif operation == '-':
         result = num1 - num2
     elif operation == '*':
         result = num1 * num2
     elif operation == '/':
         if num2 != 0:
             result = num1 / num2
         else:
             result = "Cannot divide by zero."
     else:
         result = "Invalid operation."

     print("Result:", result)
     ```
   - **Ticket Price Calculator**: Determine ticket price based on age and student status.
     ```python
     age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
     is_student = input("Are you a student? (yes/no): ").lower()

     if age < 5:
         price = "Free"
     elif age < 12:
         price = "$10"
     elif age < 17:
         if is_student == "yes":
             price = "$12"
         else:
             price = "$15"
     else:
         price = "$20"

     print("Ticket price:", price)
     ```

### 7. **Common Errors and Best Practices**
   - **Indentation Errors**: Ensure proper indentation for `if`, `elif`, and `else` blocks. Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors.
   - **Missing Colons**: Always include a colon (`:`) after the condition in `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
   - **Logical Errors**: Ensure conditions are logically correct to avoid unexpected behavior.

---

### 8. **Key Takeaways**
   - **Conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) are used to control the flow of a program based on conditions.
   - **Nested conditional statements** allow for complex decision-making by placing conditions inside other conditions.
   - Proper **indentation** and **logical conditions** are crucial for writing error-free conditional statements.

In the next session, we will cover:
- **Loops**: `for` and `while` loops for iterative tasks.
- **More advanced control flow** techniques.
