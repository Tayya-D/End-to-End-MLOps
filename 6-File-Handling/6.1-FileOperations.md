# Python File Operations Documentation

## Overview
This documentation covers essential file operations in Python including reading, writing, and manipulating both text and binary files.

## Core File Operations

### 1. Reading Files
```python
# Read entire file
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Read line by line
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # strip() removes newline characters
```

### 2. Writing Files
```python
# Write mode (overwrites existing content)
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello World\n")
    file.write("This is a new line\n")

# Append mode (adds to existing content)
with open('example.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write("Appended content\n")

# Writing multiple lines
lines = ["First line\n", "Second line\n", "Third line\n"]
with open('example.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.writelines(lines)
```

### 3. Binary Files
```python
# Writing to binary file
with open('example.bin', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(b'Binary data example')

# Reading from binary file
with open('example.bin', 'rb') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)  # b'Binary data example'
```

### 4. File Copy Operation
```python
# Copy file content
with open('source.txt', 'r') as source_file:
    with open('destination.txt', 'w') as dest_file:
        content = source_file.read()
        dest_file.write(content)
```

### 5. Read-Write Mode (w+)
```python
with open('example.txt', 'w+') as file:
    # Write operations
    file.write("Line 1\n")
    file.write("Line 2\n")
    
    # Move cursor to beginning before reading
    file.seek(0)
    
    # Read operations
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

## File Modes Reference

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 'r'  | Read (default) |
| 'w'  | Write (overwrites) |
| 'a'  | Append |
| 'r+' | Read and write |
| 'w+' | Write and read (overwrites) |
| 'a+' | Append and read |
| 'rb'/'wb' | Binary read/write |

## Best Practices

1. **Always use context managers** (`with` statements) for automatic file closing
2. **Handle file paths carefully** - use absolute paths or ensure files exist
3. **Be mindful of cursor position** - use `seek(0)` when switching between read/write
4. **Strip newlines** when processing text files (`line.strip()`)
5. **Handle exceptions** for missing files or permission issues

## Advanced Operations

### Counting File Statistics
```python
def count_file_stats(file_path):
    lines = words = chars = 0
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            lines += 1
            words += len(line.split())
            chars += len(line)
    return lines, words, chars

lines, words, chars = count_file_stats('example.txt')
```

### File Position Handling
```python
with open('example.txt', 'r+') as file:
    # Get current position
    pos = file.tell()
    
    # Read first 10 characters
    chunk = file.read(10)
    
    # Move to specific position
    file.seek(20)
    
    # Write at position
    file.write("INSERT")
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Python provides simple yet powerful file handling capabilities
2. Different modes support various read/write combinations
3. Binary files require specific 'b' mode indicators
4. Context managers ensure proper resource cleanup
5. Cursor position management is crucial for read-write operations

This documentation covers the fundamental file operations needed for most Python projects. The examples demonstrate practical patterns for working with files in real-world applications.
