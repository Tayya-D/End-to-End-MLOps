# MLOps Notes Summary

## File and Directory Operations with Python's `os` Module

### Creating a Directory
```python
import os
os.mkdir("package")  # Creates a new directory named "package"
print(f"directory package created")
```

### Listing Files and Directories
```python
items = os.listdir(".")  # Lists all items in current directory
print(items)  # Output: ['file1.txt', 'folder1', 'example.bin', ...]
```

### Joining Paths (Cross-Platform Compatible)
```python
directory_name = "folder"
file_name = "file.txt"
full_path = os.path.join(directory_name, file_name)  # 'folder/file.txt'

# With current working directory
complete_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), directory_name, file_name)
```

### Checking Path Existence
```python
file_path = "example1.txt"
if os.path.exists(file_path):
    print(f"The path {file_path} exists")
else:
    print(f"The path {file_path} does not exist")
    # Optionally create the file if it doesn't exist
```

### Checking File/Directory Type
```python
path = "example.txt"
if os.path.isfile(path):
    print(f"{path} is a file")
elif os.path.isdir(path):
    print(f"{path} is a directory")
else:
    print(f"{path} is neither a file nor directory")
```

### Getting Absolute Paths
```python
relative_path = "folder/example.txt"
absolute_path = os.path.abspath(relative_path)
print(absolute_path)  # Outputs full system path
```

## Key Concepts
- **Relative Path**: Path relative to current working directory (e.g., `folder/file.txt`)
- **Absolute Path**: Complete system path (e.g., `/home/user/project/folder/file.txt`)

## Best Practices
- Always use `os.path.join()` instead of hardcoding paths for cross-platform compatibility
- Check if paths exist before file operations to avoid errors
- Use absolute paths when you need to be certain of the file location
- The `os` module is essential for end-to-end projects working with multiple files/directories

These operations are fundamental for MLOps workflows when managing model files, datasets, and project structures.
