## Course Content

### 1. **Lifecycle of a Data Science Project**
   - **Requirement Gathering**: 
     - Involves domain experts, product owners, and business analysts.
     - Requirements are documented and divided into sprints using Agile methodology.
   - **Data Identification**:
     - Data scientists and analysts identify data sources (internal databases, third-party APIs, IoT devices, etc.).
   - **Data Pipeline Creation**:
     - Big data engineering teams create ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines using tools like **Apache Airflow**.
     - Data is extracted from multiple sources, transformed, and loaded into databases like **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL**.
   - **Data Ingestion**:
     - Data is read from sources like AWS S3, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.
     - **DVC (Data Version Control)** is used for data versioning.
   - **Feature Engineering**:
     - Basic feature engineering techniques like handling missing values, outliers, and feature selection are covered.
   - **Model Creation & Hyperparameter Tuning**:
     - Multiple models are created and tuned using tools like **Hyperopt**, **GridSearchCV**, and **RandomizedSearchCV**.
   - **Experiment Tracking**:
     - **MLflow** is used for tracking experiments, logging metrics, and parameters.
   - **Model Deployment**:
     - Models are deployed using cloud platforms like **AWS** and **Azure**.
     - **AWS SageMaker** is used for building, deploying, and creating endpoints.
   - **Model Monitoring**:
     - **Grafana** is used for visualizing model performance and setting up monitoring rules.
